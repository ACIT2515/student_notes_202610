"""Simple mood check-in application for tracking your location and mood.

This program helps you keep track of where you are and how you're feeling
throughout the day. It saves your check-ins to a CSV file so you can look
back at them later.

How to use:
    python checkin.py work happy
    python checkin.py home relaxed
    python checkin.py --location "coffee shop" --mood productive

The program will tell you how long it's been since your last check-in
and how your location and mood have changed.
