# ACIT 2515


## The course

ACIT2515 is a course about programming in Python, including Object Oriented
Programming. It is not a software development course, and will **not** make you
a developer. It will help you solve problems and automate various area's.

If you really want to be a developer you will need additional programming
courses, and there are better program ie. CST (Computer Science) or FSWD
(fullstack / web dev).

## Goals of Programming and therefore this course

1. Learn to organize our thinking when solving problems. Most importantly break
   things down into smaller problems. Object Orientation is one way to do this.
2. Communicate understanding of a problem to others (often our future selves)
3. Specify what we want the computer to do.
4. Verify that the outcome is correct and/or desired.
5. Construct solutions so that they can be changed or adapted.
6. Think and work with a high degree of precision and detail

These skills are transferable outside of the programming domain.

## Practice / How To Avoid: "Do you even lift bro?"

- The only way to get better at programming is to practice.
- Programming includes writing programs ("coding"), and ... reading code,
  designing solutions, testing code, and debugging code.
- Try to think of programming like exercise or playing an instrument. You don't
  get fitter by watching videos of other people working out. You have to _do it_
  and practice, all of the different activities.
- By the way, a lot of the things you practiced become almost useless once you
  are a seasoned driver (parallel parking?). Same here!

## The 8 Hundred Pound Gorilla: LLMs/AI

- Yes, "AI" can write most of the code for this course. You may finish quickly
  and feel competent, but beware of the
  [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://youtu.be/4FGnb2lgPBA?feature=shared).
- Delegating to AI doesn't build programming skills. It's like getting someone
  else to lift weights for you.
- AI-generated code often requires you to already know the answer to understand
  or fix it.
- See this [Vibe Coding Critique](https://youtu.be/1A6uPztchXk?feature=shared)
  for more insight.
- LLM AIs can hallucinate (produce incorrect or misleading code).


## Intelligent Usage

- If you are going to use AI use it as a tutor .
- Turn off AI autocomplete - it will answer before you get a chance
- Review and critique AI-generated code to improve your own coding skills.

## Class schedule

- **before** class: flipped learning and self-study
  - review content (available on the Learning Hub)
  - practice coding
- **during** class:
  - short quiz (30 mins max) - often on paper / alternating weeks
  - short "lecture" (30 mins to 1 hour)
  - coding / practice
